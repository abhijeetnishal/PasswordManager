### 1. How to center the item with position absolute:
```css
.messageDiv{
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}
```
* With position: absolute you can fix the position in div and that position is always fixed and that item is always displayed thier.

### 2. Code Reusability in CSS:
* It is important to reuse the same div container class name or id if you are creating same style to other container instead of copy pasting same code. <br>
e.g. I used same css code for both login and register page with Register.css file and also in Header.css file for both auth or non auth navbar.
